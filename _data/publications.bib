	Abstract = {Protein kinases are critical therapeutic targets. Pim kinases are implicated in several leukaemias and cancers. Here, we exploit a protein nanopore sensor for Pim kinases that bears a pseudosubstrate peptide attached by an enhanced engineering approach. Analyte binding to the sensor peptide is measured through observation of the modulation of ionic current through a single nanopore. We observed synergistic binding of MgATP and kinase to the sensor, which was used to develop a superior method to evaluate Pim kinase inhibitors featuring label-free determination of inhibition constants. The procedure circumvents many sources of bias or false-positives inherent in current assays. For example, we identified a potent inhibitor missed by differential scanning fluorimetry. The approach is also amenable to implementation on high throughput chips.},

@article{Harrington2013aa,
	Abstract = {In stochastic sensing, the association and dissociation of analyte molecules is observed as the modulation of an ionic current flowing through a single engineered protein pore, enabling the label-free determination of rate and equilibrium constants with respect to a specific binding site. We engineered sensors based on the staphylococcal α-hemolysin pore to allow the single-molecule detection and characterization of protein kinase-peptide interactions. We enhanced this approach by using site-specific proteolysis to generate pores bearing a single peptide sensor element attached by an N-terminal peptide bond to the trans mouth of the pore. Kinetics and affinities for the Pim protein kinases (Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase were measured and found to be independent of membrane potential and in good agreement with previously reported data. Kinase binding exhibited a distinct current noise behavior that forms a basis for analyte discrimination. Finally, we observed unusually high association rate constants for the interaction of Pim kinases with their consensus substrate Pimtide (~10(7) to 10(8) M(-1) · s(-1)), the result of electrostatic enhancement, and propose a cellular role for this phenomenon.},

@article{Kong2013aa,
	Abstract = {Capsular polysaccharides form the outermost protective layer around many Gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics aimed directly at weakening this layer are not yet available. In pathogenic Escherichia coli E69, a protein, Wza, forms a pore in the outer membrane that transports K30 capsular polysaccharide from its site of synthesis to the outside of the cell. This therefore represents a prospective antibiotic target. Here we test a variety of grommet-like mimics of K30 capsular polysaccharide on wild-type Wza and on mutant open forms of the pore by electrical recording in planar lipid bilayers. The most effective glycomimetic was the unnatural cyclic octasaccharide octakis(6-deoxy-6-amino)cyclomaltooctaose (am8γCD), which blocks the α-helix barrel of Wza, a site that is directly accessible from the external medium. This glycomimetic inhibited K30 polysaccharide transport in live E. coli E69. With the protective outer membrane disrupted, the bacteria can be recognized and killed by the human immune system.},
