        abstract: An improved method for the semisynthesis of a potassium channel
            involving native chemical ligation allows the introduction of short sequences
            containing non-canonical amino acids at any position within the polypeptide
            chain. The work enhances the technology available for a range of fundamental
            investigations of membrane proteins and for applications of membrane channels
            and pores in biotechnology.

        abstract: In stochastic sensing, the association and dissociation of analyte
            molecules is observed as the modulation of an ionic current flowing through
            a single engineered protein pore, enabling the label-free determination
            of rate and equilibrium constants with respect to a specific binding site.
            We engineered sensors based on the staphylococcal α-hemolysin pore to
            allow the single-molecule detection and characterization of protein kinase-peptide
            interactions. We enhanced this approach by using site-specific proteolysis
            to generate pores bearing a single peptide sensor element attached by
            an N-terminal peptide bond to the trans mouth of the pore. Kinetics and
            affinities for the Pim protein kinases (Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3) and cAMP-dependent
            protein kinase were measured and found to be independent of membrane potential
            and in good agreement with previously reported data. Kinase binding exhibited
            a distinct current noise behavior that forms a basis for analyte discrimination.
            Finally, we observed unusually high association rate constants for the
            interaction of Pim kinases with their consensus substrate Pimtide (~10(7)
            to 10(8) M(-1) · s(-1)), the result of electrostatic enhancement, and
            propose a cellular role for this phenomenon.

        abstract: Protein kinases are critical therapeutic targets. Pim kinases are
            implicated in several leukaemias and cancers. Here, we exploit a protein
            nanopore sensor for Pim kinases that bears a pseudosubstrate peptide attached
            by an enhanced engineering approach. Analyte binding to the sensor peptide
            is measured through observation of the modulation of ionic current through
            a single nanopore. We observed synergistic binding of MgATP and kinase
            to the sensor, which was used to develop a superior method to evaluate
            Pim kinase inhibitors featuring label-free determination of inhibition
            constants. The procedure circumvents many sources of bias or false-positives
            inherent in current assays. For example, we identified a potent inhibitor
            missed by differential scanning fluorimetry. The approach is also amenable
            to implementation on high throughput chips.

        abstract: Capsular polysaccharides form the outermost protective layer around
            many Gram-negative bacteria. Antibiotics aimed directly at weakening this
            layer are not yet available. In pathogenic Escherichia coli E69, a protein,
            Wza, forms a pore in the outer membrane that transports K30 capsular polysaccharide
            from its site of synthesis to the outside of the cell. This therefore
            represents a prospective antibiotic target. Here we test a variety of
            grommet-like mimics of K30 capsular polysaccharide on wild-type Wza and
            on mutant open forms of the pore by electrical recording in planar lipid
            bilayers. The most effective glycomimetic was the unnatural cyclic octasaccharide
            octakis(6-deoxy-6-amino)cyclomaltooctaose (am8γCD), which blocks the α-helix
            barrel of Wza, a site that is directly accessible from the external medium.
            This glycomimetic inhibited K30 polysaccharide transport in live E. coli
            E69. With the protective outer membrane disrupted, the bacteria can be
            recognized and killed by the human immune system.
