Although synthetic biology is a fairly new field, it's been around long enough for there to be many different definitions of what it actually is.

Many of those who founded and developed the field in the early days came from backgrounds outside biology, in particular from computer or electrical engineering backgrounds. To them biology was a mess, a jumble of observations on model systems with few unifying principles. Any attempt to design or engineer biological systems was fraught with unpredictable consequences that meant that trial-and-error was the only possible strategy.

As engineers, they saw the need to impose order on these systems, by establishing well-behaved, modular units that could be predictably combined to deliver a desired outcome. In particular, a degree of <strong>abstraction</strong> was necessary, taking inspiration from computer coding.

Computer code operates at different levels of abstraction. Basic instructions are written in 'machine code', extremely dense binary code that describes every detail and is highly impenetrable to a human reader. In contrast, day-to-day 'high-level' programming languages consist of sets of functions that conceal the underlying 'low-level' machine code. These functions can be strung together according to the syntax of the programming language to give the desired outcome of the program.

In a similar fashion, synthetic biologists wished to have biological modules possessing functions that were abstracted from the underlying code---be it DNA, RNA, amino acids etc. This YouTube video featuring Drew Endy is a great, succinct explanation, even if it is a bit old now...

Our new publication is out in [Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B, Biological Sciences](https://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2017.0104).

It's part of a special issue on self-organisation in cell biology, which is worth a read in [its entirety](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/373/1747).

In our contribution to the issue we describe two different engineering strategies for understanding protein pattern formation from the perspective of the most studied model system, MinCDE. We start by describing some new experimental data that exemplify a conventional reverse engineering strategy based on in vitro reconstitution.

The rest of the paper then introduces the concept of forward engineering---testing hypotheses by building experimental models. This approach is perhaps most common in physics, where it is common to construct (often highly elaborate and costly!) experiments to test theories. In biology however, it has only recently begun to be adopted by the pioneering groups in synthetic biology. Due to the 'fuzziness' of biology, it's still very difficult to do, but the benefits are clear.

We consider how such an approach could help us understand protein pattern formation better, and argue that tackling such problems from both directions, whereby reverse and forward engineering feed into each other in a virtuous cycle, is the most efficient way to gain further insight.
