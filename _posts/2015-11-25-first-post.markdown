I moved this year from the [University of Oxford](http://bayley.chem.ox.ac.uk/lharrington/ "My old Oxford page") to the Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry in Munich. Unfortunately our work webpages are pretty [minimal](http://www.biochem.mpg.de/205324/employee_page?c=1124057&employee_id=40833 "My Max-Planck page"). So here I've made my 'official' website, with everything about me, my work, and how you can get in touch.

I spent a long time mulling over the technical aspects---what kind of hosting, what blog platform to use. I settled on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll homepage") and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "Github Pages"), and so far I think they're pretty awesome. I'll write more on this soon.

As I approach the end of my first year working as a post-doc in Germany, I'll also write a round-up of my experiences that I hope will be of help to others considering the move.

Other than that, I plan to blog semi-regularly on aspects of academic life, technology, and my academic work. Check back soon.
