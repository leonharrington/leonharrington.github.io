I'm very excited that I have been awarded not one, but two post-doctoral fellowships to fund my work in the [Schwille research group](http://www.biochem.mpg.de/en/rd/schwille).

From February 2016, I will be working as a Humboldt Research Fellow, funded by a Post-doctoral Research Fellowship from the [Alexander von Humboldt Foundation](http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/home.html).

Later, I will move on to a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie [Individual Fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm) for the rest of my time here.

It's a great honour to get one fellowship, yet alone two. I'm very grateful for such great reviews of my proposed research, and I hope to share my progress on this blog in the coming years.

Cheers!
