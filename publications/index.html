            <p>Protein kinases are critical therapeutic targets. Pim kinases are implicated in several leukaemias and cancers. Here, we exploit a protein nanopore sensor for Pim kinases that bears a pseudosubstrate peptide attached by an enhanced engineering approach. Analyte binding to the sensor peptide is measured through observation of the modulation of ionic current through a single nanopore. We observed synergistic binding of MgATP and kinase to the sensor, which was used to develop a superior method to evaluate Pim kinase inhibitors featuring label-free determination of inhibition constants. The procedure circumvents many sources of bias or false-positives inherent in current assays. For example, we identified a potent inhibitor missed by differential scanning fluorimetry. The approach is also amenable to implementation on high throughput chips.</p>
